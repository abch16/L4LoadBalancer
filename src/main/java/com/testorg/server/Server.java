/**
 * Server - Backend Server Implementation
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: Represents individual backend servers in the 1999 scale-up architecture
 *
 * This class implements the crucial concept of DUAL STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *
 * ðŸ”§ Administrative Availability (isAvailable):
 * - Manual control by operations team
 * - Used for planned maintenance, deployments, capacity management
 * - Set via setAvailable(true/false)
 * - Example: "Take Server-2 out of rotation for OS patching"
 *
 * ðŸ’“ Health Status (isHealthy):
 * - Automatic monitoring by HealthCheckManager
 * - Reflects actual server responsiveness and functionality
 * - Updated by health check system every 5 seconds
 * - Example: "Server-3 stopped responding to health checks"
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ Key Rule: A server must be BOTH available AND healthy to receive requests
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Why Separate These States?
 * - Administrative Control: Ops can manually manage servers
 * - Automatic Detection: System can detect failures without human intervention
 * - Clear Responsibility: Manual vs automatic state management
 * - Operational Clarity: "Is it down by design or by accident?"
 *
 * ðŸš€ Request Handling Logic:
 * - Available + Healthy = Handle requests normally
 * - Unavailable + Healthy = "Server is administratively down"
 * - Available + Unhealthy = "Server failed health check"
 * - Unavailable + Unhealthy = Still shows administrative reason (takes precedence)

    /**
     * Handle Request - Core server functionality with dual state logic
     *
     * This method demonstrates the practical application of dual state management.
     * It shows how administrative and health states work together to provide
     * clear operational feedback.
     *
     *  Business Logic:
     * - Only handle requests if BOTH available AND healthy
     * - Provide specific error messages for different failure modes
     * - Administrative failures take precedence in error messaging
     *
     *  Why This Matters:
     * - Operations team gets clear feedback on WHY a server isn't serving
     * - Different failure modes may require different remediation actions
     * - Helps distinguish between planned vs unplanned service interruptions
     *
     * Thread Safety Note:
     * - This method is called concurrently by multiple threads
     * - Reading server state (isAvailable, isHealthy) during concurrent updates
     * - May see inconsistent state during transitions
